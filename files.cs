/*
The System.IO namespace has various classes that are used for performing numerous operations with files, such as creating and deleting files, reading from or writing to a file, closing a file, and more.
The File class is one of them. For example:
string str = "Some text";
File.WriteAllText("test.txt", str);

The WriteAllText() method creates a file with the specified path and writes the content to it. If the file already exists, it is overwritten. 
The code above creates a file test.txt and writes the contents of the str string into it.
To use the File class you need to use the System.IO namespace: using System.IO;

You can read the content of a file using the ReadAllText method of the File class:
string txt = File.ReadAllText("test.txt");
Console.WriteLine(txt); 

This will output the content of the test.txt file.
The following methods are available in the File class:
AppendAllText() - appends text to the end of the file.
Create() - creates a file in the specified location.
Delete() - deletes the specified file.
Exists() - determines whether the specified file exists.
Copy() - copies a file to a new location.
Move() - moves a specified file to a new location
All methods automatically close the file after performing the operation.
